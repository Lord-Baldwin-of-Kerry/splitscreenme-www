How do I use it?

1.- Download and extract Nucleus Co-Op (extract using apps like 7-zip or winrar).

2.- Open NucleusCoop.exe.

3.- Click on Download Game Scripts, search for a game in the [supported games](https://www.reddit.com/r/nucleuscoop/comments/opu0eg/list_of_nucleus_coop_supported_games/) list and download a script.

4.- Once the script has finished downloading you will get a prompt asking if you would like to add a game now, press yes if you want to add it now, if you select no proceed to step 6.

5.- Next you need to find where your game's executable is located. If you're not sure, try Googling 'where is (game) installed' and just searching for .exe in the place they tell you to look. For Steam games this is usually something along the lines of 'C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common(game)'. Some games will have their .exe stashed away in a folder called 'bin' or 'binaries' inside that place. Once you choose the right .exe, add the game.

6.- You can also automatically add games, click 'Auto-Search' and select the drive and path you want to add games from.

7.- Once your game is added, select it in the Nucleus UI and drag the gamepads/KBM icons to the splitscreen layout, click on the top-left icon on the layout corner to change the type of splitscreen layout. You can also right click a player in the layout to change the size.

8.- Finally press play and you are ready to go.
