You can download the latest version from [GitHub](https://github.com/nucleuscoop/nucleuscoop/releases/latest).

Extract the .rar file and start the application.

:::caution Please Note 
Please note that some games require you to start the application as Administrator.

Some games may also require you to have your Nucleus Co-op installation in a folder that:
1. Is on the same drive as the game.
2. Is not in a user restricted folder, this includes folders like `downloads`, `documents`, `desktop`. 
A good option is to put the application inside a root folder, for example `C:\NucleusCoop`

:::tip How To Download Earlier Versions 
You can download earlier versions of Nucleus Co-op from [Lucas's](https://github.com/lucasassislar/nucleuscoop)
or [Zerofox's](https://github.com/ZeroFox5866/nucleuscoop/releases) GitHub repos. Note that these versions will not
support as many games, and that we no longer provide customer support for earlier versions.
